//! Precedence definitions for the Pratt-[`Parser`](crate::compilation::Parser)
//!
//! Defines the different precedence levels used by the infix parsers.
//! These determine how a series of infix expressions will be grouped.
//! For example, "a + b * c - d" will be parsed as "(a + (b * c)) - d"
//! because "*" has higher precedence than "+" and "-".
//! Inn case of same precedence the source is parsed from left to right.
//! Here a bigger enum value is higher precedence.
